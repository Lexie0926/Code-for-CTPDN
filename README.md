# Code-for-CTPDN
This repository consist of codes and datasets for the identification of effective compounds from “compound-target-pathway-disease” network (CTPDN) by integration machine learning-assisted approach. This approach mainly had two computational stage that the first is to lock the shortest path from compound to disease by Floyd-Warshall algorithm, and then to identify the compound-target interaction by a feature-bsaed prediction model established by Adaboost.
A main application of this repository is to identify the key compound, target and pathway that underpin the efficacy of an herbal formula.
